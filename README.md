# Private Events

> A simple Ruby on Rails App for practicing Associations.


In this project, we built a site similar to [Eventbrite](http://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and manage user signups.
A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.

 - First task was creating the User model and adding the validations
 - Then we added a sign up/sign in functionality
 - We also added the views for showing a users profile page
 - Next we added sessions to store user identity
 - Then we added the Event model 
 - Next we added event creation, views for showing individual events, and index for showing all events
 - After that we added the functionality needed for users to be able to join/leave events
 - Then we further refactored the app to show previous events and upcoming events
 - The users page showed the events that the user created and the events the user had joined

 The original project requirments can be found on The Odin Project - [Private Events](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations#project-2-private-events )
